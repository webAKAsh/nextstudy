## User Data for Office use

The project has CRUD and authentication features through which office employes can read clients data, can able to update, can easily delete a particular entry and can even also add a new client data.
I have used Firebase as a backend with some features of redux also, so project stack is Next.js + redux + Firebase + Tailwind CSS. Further features will be added in near future, Hope you like It!

## Run the Project
npm install
npm run dev

## ENJOY THE APP
Happy Hacking !
